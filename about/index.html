    <h2>Chris 'Moggles' Phelps :: Founder and CEO</h2>
    <p>Chris has been doing desktop and server management for fifteen years now.  He founded Alfheim Software on the premise that "If it feels right, then it is right.  If it feels wrong, then it is wrong."
    His one goal is to provide software solutioons to the common ills he sees within the current software stack.  A deeply held belief that open source is the only true software movement he aims to release
    as much of the Alfheim Software under the MIT license as is possible.</p>
